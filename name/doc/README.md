Namecoin Core
==============

Setup
---------------------
[Namecoin Core](http://namecoin.org/) is the official Namecoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Namecoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Namecoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/namecoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/namecoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run namecoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Namecoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Namecoin-Qt.
